CPU version just to have a baseline, this version is sequential and 
the idea will be to extract all the information that I can from the 
processor that this will be running. Such as Instructions per second
executed, Instructions stalled, the usage of front and back end of the
CPU, cache usage, vector units usage, etc...

My first approach will be using perf linux tools but depending on 
availability will use othes.
